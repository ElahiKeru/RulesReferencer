		<title>The D20</title>
		<details>     In cases where the outcome of an action is uncertain, the game relies on rolls of a 20-sided die, a d20, to determine success and failure. Every character and monster in the game has capabilities defined by six [ABILITY SCORE]s. These ability scores and the [ABILITY MODIFIER]s derived from them are the basis for almost every d20 roll that a player makes on a character's or monster's behalf. [ABILITY CHECK]s, [ATTACK ROLL]s, and [SAVING THROW]s are the three main kinds of d20 rolls, forming the core of the rules of the game. All three follow these simple steps.
     1.) Roll the die and add a modifier - Roll a d20 and add the relevant modifier. This is typically a modifier derived from one of the six [ABILITY SCORE]s and it sometimes includes a [PROFICIENCY BONUS] to reflect a character's particular skill.
     2.) Apply circumstantial bonuses and penalties - A class feature, spell, particular circumstance, or some other effect might give a bonus or penalty to the check
     3.) Compare the total to a target number - If the total equals or exceeds the target number, the [ABILITY CHECK], [ATTACK ROLL], or [SAVING THROW] is a success. Otherwise it's a failure. The DM is usually the one who determines the target numbers and tells players whether their [ABILITY CHECK]s, [ATTACK ROLL]s, and [SAVING THROW]s succeed or fail.
     The target number for an [ABILITY CHECK] or [SAVING THROW] is called a [DIFFICULTY CLASS (DC)].
     The target number for an [ATTACK ROLL] is called an [ARMOR CLASS (AC)].</details>
	</rule>
	<rule>
		<title>Advantage/Disadvantage</title>
		<details>     Sometimes an [ABILITY CHECK], [ATTACK ROLL], or [SAVING THROW] is modified by special situations called [ADVANTAGE] and [DISADVANTAGE]. [ADVANTAGE] reflects the positive circumstances surrounding a d20 roll, while [DISADVANTAGE] reflects the opposite. You roll a second d20 when you make the roll. Use the higher of the two rolls if you have [ADVANTAGE], and the lower of the two when you have [DISADVANTAGE]. You cannot stack [ADVANTAGE] and [DISADVANTAGE] - if you get both from different circumstances they cancel out. Further you cannot stack multiple instances of [ADVANTAGE] or [DISADVANTAGE]. You will only ever have one extra die roll for a given situation.
     When you have [ADVANTAGE] or [DISADVANTAGE] and something in the game, such as the halfling's Lucky trait, lets you reroll the d20, you can reroll only one of the dice. You choose which one. You usually gain advantage or disadvantage through the use of special abilities, actions, or spells. Inspiration can also give a character advantage on checks related to the character's personality, ideals, or bonds. The DM can also decide that circumstances influence a roll in one direction or the other and grant advantage or impose disadvantage as a result.</details>
	</rule>
	<rule>
		<title>Level</title>
		<details>     Typically, a character starts at 1st level and advances in level by adventuring and gaining [EXPERIENCE POINTS (XP)]. Depending on the situation however, your [DUNGEON MASTER (DM)] may have you build a character above first level.</details>
	</rule>
	<rule>
		<title>Hit Points and Hit Dice</title>
		<details>     Your character's [HIT POINTS (HP)] define how tough your character is in combat and other dangerous situations. Your hit points are determined by your [HIT DICE] (Short for Hit Point Dice).
     At first level, your character has 1 [HIT DICE], and the die type is determined by your class. You start with [HIT POINTS (HP)] equal to the highest roll of that die, as indicated in your class description. You also add your [CONSTITUTION MODIFIER]. This is also your [HIT POINT MAXIMUM].</details>
	</rule>
	<rule>
		<title>Proficiency Bonus</title>
		<details>     The table that appears in your class description shows your [PROFICIENCY BONUS], which is +2 for a 1st-level character. Your [PROFICIENCY BONUS] applies to many of the numbers you'll be recording on a character sheet:
     - [ATTACK ROLL]s using weapons you're proficient with.
     - [ATTACK ROLL]s with spells you cast.
     - [ABILITY CHECK]s using skills you're proficient in.
     - [ABILITY CHECK]s using tools you're proficient with.
     - [SAVING THROW]s you're proficient in.
     - [SAVING THROW] [DIFFICULTY CLASS (DC)]s for spells you cast (Explained in each spellcasting class)
     Your class determins your weapon proficiencies, your saving throw proficiencies, and some of your skill and tool proficiencies. Your background gives you additional skill and tool proficiencies, and some races give you more proficiencies.
     Your [PROFICIENCY BONUS] can't be added to a single die roll or other number more than once. Occasionally, your proficiency bonus might be modified (doubled or halved, for example) before you apply it. IF a circumstance suggests that your [PROFICIENCY BONUS] applies more than once to the same roll or taht it should be multiplied more than once, you nevertheless add it only once, multiply it only once, and halve it only once.</details>
	</rule>
	<rule>
		<title>Ability Scores</title>
		<details>     Much of what your character does in the game depends on his or her six [ABILITY SCORE]s: [STRENGTH (STR)], [DEXTERITY (DEX)], [CONSTITUTION (CON)], [INTELLIGENCE (INT)], [WISDOM (WIS)], [CHARISMA (CHA)]. Each ability has a score, which is a number recorded on the character sheet.
     There are several methods for generating your six [ABILITY SCORE]s:
     - Roll 4: Roll 4d6 and drop the lowest dice. Repeat this process until you have 6 numbers.
     - Roll 3: Roll 3d6. Repeat this process until you have 6 numbers.
     - Point-Buy: you have 27 points to spend on your [ABILITY SCORE]s, which all start at and can go no lower than 8. The cost breakdown is as such:
          8  -> 0 points
          9  -> 1 point
          10 -> 2 points
          11 -> 3 points
          12 -> 4 points
          13 -> 5 points
          14 -> 7 points
          15 -> 9 points
     Using this system, you cannot obtain a score higher than 15 in a given ability.
     After ascertaining your [ABILITY SCORE]s, you must ascertain your [ABILITY MODIFIER]s by applying the following formula:
          ([ABILITY SCORE] - 10) / 2, rounded DOWN.

		<title>Armor Properties</title>
		<details>     Armor table on PHB page 145 shows the cost, weight, and other properties of common armor types worn in the worlds of D&amp;D.
     Armor Proficiency: Anyone can put on a suit of armor or strap on a shield, Only those proficient in the armor's use know how to wear it effectively, however. Your class gives you proficiency in certain types of armor and optionally shields. If you wear armor that you lack proficiency with, you have disadvantage on any ability check, saving throw, or attack roll that involves Strength or Dexterity, and you can't cast spells.
     [ARMOR CLASS (AC)]: Armor protects its wearer from attacks. The armor (and shield) you wear determines your base [ARMOR CLASS (AC)].
     Heavy Armor: Heavier armor interferes with the wearer's ability to move quickly, stealthily, and freely. If the Armor Table shows "Str 13" or "Str 15" in the Strength column for an armor type, the armor reduced the wearer's speed by 10 feet unless the wearer has a Strength score equal to or greater than the listed score.
     Stealth: If the Armor Table shows "Disadvantage" in the Stealth column, the wearer has disadvantage on Stealth checks.
     Shields: A shield is made from wood or metal and is carried in one hand. Wielding a shield increases your [ARMOR CLASS (AC)] by 2. You can benefit from only one shield at a time.</details>
	</rule>
	<rule>
		<title>Weapon Proficiency</title>
		<details>     Your race, class, and feats can grant you proficiency with certain weapons or categories of weapons. The two categories are Simple and Martial. Most people can use simple weapons with proficiency. These weapons include clubs, maces, and other weapons often found in the hands of commoners. Martial weapons, including swords, axes, and polearms, require more specialized training to use effectively. Most warriors use Martial weapons because these weapons put their fighting style and training to best use.
     Proficiency with a weapon allows you to add your [PROFICIENCY BONUS] to the attack roll for any attack you make with that weapon. If you make an attack roll using a weapon with which you lack proficiency, you do not add your proficiency bonus to the attack roll.</details>
	</rule>
	<rule>
		<title>Weapon Properties</title>
		<details>     Ammunition: You can use a weapon that has the ammunition property to make a ranged attack only if you have ammunition to fire from the weapon. Each time you attack with the weapon, you expend one piece of ammunition. Drawing the ammunition from a quiver, case, or other container is part of the attack. At the end of the battle you can recover half of your expended ammunition by taking a minute to search the battlefield.
     If you use a weapon that has the ammunition property to make a melee attack, you treat the weapon as an [IMPROVISED WEAPON]. A sling must be loaded to deal any damage when used in this way.
     Finesse: When making an attack with a finesse weapon, you use your choice of your Strength or Dexterity modifier for the attack and damage rolls. You must use the same modifier for both rolls.
     Heavy: Small creatures have disadvantage on attack rolls with heavy weapons. A heavy weapon's size and bulk make it too large for a small creature to use effectively.
     Light: A light weapon is small and easy to handle, making it ideal for use when fighting with two weapons.
     Loading: Because of the time required to load this weapon, you can fire only one piece of ammunition from it when you use an action, bonus action, or reaction to fire it. Regardless of the number of attacks you can normally make.
     Range: A weapon that can be used to make a ranged attack has a range shown in parentheses after the ammunition or thrown property. The range lists two numbers. the first is the weapon's normal range in feet, and the second indicates the weapon's maximum range. When attacking a target beyond normal range, you have disadvantage on the attack roll. You can't attack a target beyond the weapon's long range.
     Reach: This weapon adds 5 feet to your reach when you attack with it.
     Special: A weapon with the special property has unusual rules governing its use, explained in the weapon's description.
     Thrown: If a weapon has the thrown property, you can throw the weapon to make a ranged attack. If the weapon is a melee weapon, you use the same ability modifier for that attack roll and damage roll that you would use for the melee attack with that weapon.
     Two-Handed: This weapon requires two hands to use.
     Versatile: This weapon can be used with one or two hands. A damage value in parentheses appears with the property - the damage when the weapon is used with two hands to make a melee attack.</details>
	</rule>
	<rule>
		<title>Improvised Weapon</title>
		<details>     An improvised weapon is any object you can wield in one or two hands, such as a broken glass, a table leg, a frying pan, a wagon wheel, or a dead goblin. In many cases, an improvised weapon is similar to an actual weapon and can be treated as such. For example a table leg can be considered basically a club. At the DM's option, a character proficient with a weapon can use a similar object as if it were that weapon and use his or her [PROFICIENCY BONUS].
     An object that bears no resemblance to a weapon deals 1d4 damage (the DM assigns the type of damage it deals appropriate to the object). If a character uses a ranged weapon to make a melee attack, or thros a melee weapon that doesn't have the thrown property, it also deals 1d4 damage. An improvised thrown weapon has a normal range of 20 feet and a long range of 60 feet.</details>
	</rule>
	<rule>
		<title>Silvered Weapons</title>
		<details>     Some monsters that have immunity or resistance to nonmagical weapons are susceptible to silver weapons, so cautious adventurers can invest extra coin to plate their weapons with silver. You can silver a single weapon or ten pieces of ammunition for 100 GP. This cost represents not only the price of the silver, but the time and expertise needed to add silver to the weapon without making it less effective.</details>
	</rule>
	<rule>
		<title>Multiclassing</title>
		<details>     Multiclassing allows you to gain levels in multiple classes, and lets you mix abilities of those classes to realize a character concept that might not be reflected in one of the standard class options. The effects of this are many and detailed here.
     Your levels in all of your classes are added together to determine your total character level. For example, if you're level 4 cleric, level 1 wizard, you are a level 5 character.
     Prerequisites: To qualify for a new class, you must meet the ability score prerequisites for both your current class and your new one. The Prerequisites are:
          - Barbarian -> Strength 13
          - Bard      -> Charisma 13
          - Cleric    -> Wisdom 13
          - Druid     -> Wisdom 13
          - Fighter   -> Strength or Dexterity 13
          - Monk      -> Dexterity and Wisdom 13
          - Paladin   -> Strength and Charisma 13
          - Ranger    -> Dexterity and Wisdom 13
          - Rogue     -> Dexterity 13
          - Sorcerer  -> Charisma 13
          - Warlock   -> Charisma 13
          - Wizard    -> Intelligence 13
     Experience Points: The experience point cost to level up is always based on your total character level, not your level in a particualr class.
     Hit Points and Hit Dice: You gain the hit points from your new class as described for levels after 1st. You gain the 1st-level hit points for a class only when you are a 1st-level character.
     You add together the Hit Dice granted by all your classes to form your pool of Hit Dice. If the Hit Dice are the same die type, you can simply pool them together. If your classes give you Hit Dice of different types, keep track of them separately.
     Proficiency Bonus: Your proficiency bonus is always based on your total character level, not your level in a particular class.
     Proficiencies: When you gain a level in a class other than your first, you gain only some of the class' starting proficiencies as below:
          - Barbarian -> Shields, Simple Weapons, Martial Weapons
          - Bard      -> Light Armor, One skill of your choice, one musical instrument of your choice.
          - Cleric    -> Light Armor, Medium Armor, Shields
          - Druid     -> Light Armor, Medium Armor, Shields (druids will not wear metal armor or use metal shields)
          - Fighter   -> Light Armor, Medium Armor, Shields, Simple Weapons, Martial Weapons
          - Monk      -> Simple Weapons, Shortswords
          - Paladin   -> Lgith Armor, Medium Armor, Shields, Simple Weapons, Martial Weapons
          - Ranger    -> Light Armor, Medium Armor, Shields, Simple Weapons, Martial Weapons, one skill from the class' skill list
          - Rogue     -> Light Armor, one skill from the class' skill list, thieves' tools
          - Sorcerer  -> NONE
          - Warlock   -> Light Armor, Simple Weapons
          - Wizard    -> NONE
     Class Features: When you gain a new level in a class, you get its features for that level. A few features however have additional rules when you're multiclassing:
          Channel Divinity: If you already have the Channel Divinity feature and gain it again from a new class, you gain the Channel Divinity effects granted by that class, but getting the feature again doesn't give you an additional use of it. You gain additional uses only when you reach a class level that explicitly gives them to you. Whenever you use the feature, you can choose any of the Channel Divinity effects available to you from your classes.
          Extra Attack: If you gain the Extra Attack class feature from more than one class, they do NOT stack. Similarly, the Warlock Eldritch Invocation Thirsting Blade does not stack with Extra Attack.
          Unarmored Defense: If you already have the Unarmored Defense feature, you can't gain it again from another class.
          Spellcasting: your capacity for spellcastign depends partly on your combined levels in all your spellcasting classes and partly on your individual levels in those classes. Once you have the Spellcasting feature from more than one class, the rules change in the following ways.
               Spells Known and Prepared: you determine what spells you know and can prepare for each class individually, as if you were a single-classed member of that class. Each spell you know and prepare is associated with one of your classes, and you use the spellcasting ability of that class to cast that spell. Similarly, a spellcasting focus such as a holy symbol can only be used for the spells from the class associated with that focus.
               Spell Slots: You determine your available spell slots by adding together all your levels in bard, cleric, druid, sorcerer, and wizard classes, Half your levels (rounded down) in paladin and ranger, and A Third your levels (rounded down) in fighter or rogue if you're using Eldritch Knight or Arcane Trickster. Use this total to determine your spell slots by consulting the following table. If you have more than one spellcasting class, this table might give you spell slots for a level that is higher than the spells you know and can prepare. You can use those slots, but only to cast your lower-level spells. This will trigger Higher Spell Level effects.
                    - 1  -> 2
                    - 2  -> 3
                    - 3  -> 4/2
                    - 4  -> 4/3
                    - 5  -> 4/3/2
                    - 6  -> 4/3/3
                    - 7  -> 4/3/3/1
                    - 8  -> 4/3/3/2
                    - 9  -> 4/3/3/3/1
                    - 10 -> 4/3/3/3/2
                    - 11 -> 4/3/3/3/2/1
                    - 12 -> 4/3/3/3/2/1
                    - 13 -> 4/3/3/3/2/1/1
                    - 14 -> 4/3/3/3/2/1/1
                    - 15 -> 4/3/3/3/2/1/1/1
                    - 16 -> 4/3/3/3/2/1/1/1
                    - 17 -> 4/3/3/3/2/1/1/1/1
                    - 18 -> 4/3/3/3/3/1/1/1/1
                    - 19 -> 4/3/3/3/3/2/1/1/1
                    - 20 -> 4/3/3/3/3/2/2/1/1
              Pact Magic: If you have both the Spellcasting class feature and the Pact Magic class feature from the warlock class, you can use the spell slots you gain from the Pact Magic feature to cast spells you know or have prepared from classes with the Spellcasting class feature, and you can use spell slots you gain from the Spellcasting class feature to cast warlock spells you know.

	<rule>
		<title>Ability Checks</title>
		<details>     For every ability check, the DM decides which of the six abilities is relevant to the task at hand and the difficulty of the task, represented by a Difficulty Class (DC). The more difficult the task, the higher the DC. The Typical Difficulty Classes are as such
     - Very Easy         -  5
     - Easy              - 10
     - Medium            - 15
     - Hard              - 20
     - Very Hard         - 25
     - Nearly Impossible - 30
     To make an ability check, roll a d20 and add the relevant ability modifier. As with other d20 rolls, apply bonuses and penalties and compare the total to the DC. If the total equals or exceed the DC, the check is a success, otherwise it's a failure which could mean either no progress or progress with a cost.</details>
	</rule>
	<rule>
		<title>Contests</title>
		<details>     Sometimes one character's or monster's efforts are directly opposed to another's. Thsi can occur when both of them are trying to do the same thing and only one can succeed, such as attempting to snatch up a magic ring that has fallen on the floor. This situation also applies when one of them is trying to prevent the other one from accomplishing a goal - for example, when a monster tries to force open a door that an adventurer is holding shut. In situations like these, the outcome is determined by a special form of ability checks, called a contest.
     Both participants in a contest make ability checks appropriate to their efforts. They apply all appropriate bonuses and penalties, but instead of comparing the total to a DC, they compare the totals of their checks. The participant with the higher check total wins the contest. They either succeed at the action or prevent the other from succeeding.
     If the contest results in a tie, the situation remains the same as it was before the contest. Thus, one could also win the contest by default depending on the situation.</details>
	</rule>
	<rule>
		<title>Skills</title>
		<details>     Each ability covers a broad range of capabilities, including skills thata character or monster can be proficient in. A skill represents a specific aspect of an ability score, and an individual's proficiency in a skill demonstrates a focus on that aspect.
     For example, a Dexterity check might reflect a character's attempt to pull off an acrobatic stunt, to palm an object, or to stay hidden. Each of these aspects of Dexterity has an associated skill: Acrobatics, Sleight of Hand, and Stealth, respectively. So a character who has proficiency in the Stealth skill is particularly good at Dexterity checks related to sneaking and hiding.
     The skills related to each ability score are shown in the following list (Note there's no skill tied to Constitution).
     Strength
          - Athletics
     Dexterity
          - Acrobatics
          - Sleight of Hand
          - Stealth
     Intelligence
          - Arcana
          - History
          - Investigation
          - Nature
          - Religion
     Wisdom
          - Animal Handling
          - Insight
          - Medicine
          - Perception
          - Survival
     Charisma
          - Deception
          - Intimidation
          - Performance
          - Persuasion
     Sometimes, the DM might ask for an ability check using a specific skill, at other times a player might ask the DM if proficiency in a particular skill applies to a check. In either case, proficiency in a skill means an individual can add his or her proficiency bonus to ability checks that involve this skill. Without proficiency in the skill, the individual makes a normal ability check.</details>
	</rule>
	<rule>
		<title>Skills with Different Abilities</title>
		<details>     Normally, Proficiency in a skill applies only to a specific kind of ability check. In some situations though, your proficiency might reasonably apply to a different kind of check. In such cases, the DM might ask for a check using an unusual combination of ability and skill or you might ask your DM if you can apply a proficiency to a different check. Examples of this might be Constitution applied to an Athletics check for an extended bout of exertion, or Strength applied to Intimidation for using your imposing physique.</details>
	</rule>
	<rule>
		<title>Passive Checks</title>
		<details>     A passive check is a special kind of ability check that doesn't involve any die rolls. Such a check can represent the average result for a task done repeatedly, such as searching for secret doors over and over again, or can be used when the DM wants to secretly determine whether the characters succeed at something without rolling dice, such as noticing a hidden monster. The formula for determining a passive score is 10 + all modifiers that normally apply to the check.</details>
	</rule>
	<rule>
		<title>Working Together</title>
		<details>     Sometimes two or more characters team up to attempt a task. The character who's leading the effort - or the one with the highest ability modifier - can make an ability check with advantage, reflecting the help provided by the other characters. In combat, this requires the Help action.
     A character can only provide help if the task is one that he or she could attempt alone. For instance, a character couldn't help with picking a lock without proficiency in lockpicking tools. Moreover, a character can help only when two or more individuals working together would actually be productive</details>
	</rule>
	<rule>
		<title>Group Checks</title>
		<details>     When a number of individuals are trying to accomplish the same goal as a group, the DM might ask for a group ability check. In such a situation, the characters who are skilled a particular task help cover those who aren't.
     To make a group ability check, everyone in the group makes the ability check. If at least half the group succeeds, the whole group succeeds - otherwise the group fails. Group checks don't come up very often, and they're most useful when all the characters succeed or fail as a group</details>
	</rule>
	<rule>
		<title>Strength</title>
		<details>A Strength check can model any attempt to life, push, pull, or break something, to force your body through a space, or to otherwise apply brute force to a situation.
     - Athletics: An Athletics check covers difficult situations you encounter while climbing, jumping, or swimming, such as
          - You attempt to climb a sheer or slippery cliff, avoid hazards while scaling a wall, or cling to a surface while something is trying to knock you off
          - You try to jump an unusually long distance or pull off a stunt mid-jump
          - You struggle to swim or stay afloat in treacherous currents, storm-tossed waves, or areas of thick seaweed. Another creature tries to push or pull you underwater or otherwise interferes with your swimming
     Other Strength Checks: The DM might also call for a Strength check when you try to accomplish tasks like the following
          - Force open a stuck, locked, or barred door
          - Break free of bonds
          - Push through a tunnel that is too small
          - Hang on to a wagon as you're being dragged behind it
          - Tip over a statue
          - Keep a boulder from rolling
     Attack Rolls and Damage: Typically you add your Strength modifier to your attack roll and your damage roll when attacking with a melee weapon such as a mace, a battleaxe, or a javelin. You use melee weapons to make melee attacks in hand-to-hand combat, and some of them ca be thrown to make a ranged attack
     Lifting and Carrying: Your Strength score determines the amount of weight you can bear in the following ways:
          - Carrying Capacity: Your carrying capacity is your Strength Score multiplied by 15. This is the weight (in pounds) that you can carry, which is high enough that most characters don't have to worry explicitly about it.
          - Push, Drag, or Lift: You can push, drag, or lift a weight in pounds up to twice your carrying capacity (or 30 times your Strength Score). While pushing or dragging weight in excess of your carrying capacity, your speed drops to 5 feet
          - Size and Strength: Larger creatures can bear more weight, whereas Tiny creatures can carry less. For each size category above medium, double the creature's carrying capacity and the amount if can Push, Drag, or Life. For a Tiny creature, halve these weights</details>
	</rule>
	<rule>
		<title>Variant: Encumbrance</title>
		<details>     The rules for lifting and carrying are intentionally simple - this is a variant for more in-depth rules for hindrance due to weight of equipment. When you use this variant, ignore the Strength column of the Armor table.
     If you are carrying weight in excess of 5 times your Strength Score, you are Encumbered, which means your speed drops by 10 feet.
     If you carry weight in excess of 10 times your Strength Score, you are instead Heavily Encumbered, which means your speed drops by 20 feet and you have Disadvantage on Ability Checks, Attack Rolls, and Saving Throws that use Strength, Dexterity, or Constitution</details>
	</rule>
	<rule>
		<title>Dexterity</title>
		<details>     A Dexterity check can model any attempt to move nimbly, quickly, or quietly, or to keep from falling on tricky footing. The Acrobatics, Sleight of Hand, and Stealth skills reflect aptitude in certain kinds of Dexterity checks.
     - Acrobatics: Your Acrobatics check covers your attempt to stay on your feet in a tricky situation, such as when you're trying to run across a sheet of ice, balance on a tightrope, or stay upright on a rocking ship's deck. The DM might also call for Acrobatics checks to see if you can perform stunts including dives, rolls, somersaults, and flips
     - Sleight of Hand: Whenever you attempt an act of legerdemain or manual trickery, such as planting something on someone else or concealing an object on your person, make a Slright of Hand check. The DM might lso call for a Sleight of Hand check to determine whether you can steal from someone
     - Stealth: Make a Stealth check when you attempt to conceal yourself from enemies, slink past guards, slip away without being noticed, or sneak up on someone without being seen or heard
     Other Dexterity Checks: The DM might call for a Dexterity check when you try to accomplish tasks like the following
          - Control a heavy laden cart on a steep descent
          - Steer a chariot around a tight turn
          - Pick a lock
          - Disable a trap
          - Securely tie up a prisoner
          - Wriggle free of bonds
          - Play a stringed instrument
          - Craft a small or detailed object
     Attack Rolls and Damage: You ad you Dexterity Modifier to your Attack Roll and your Damage Roll when attacking with a Ranged Weapon, such as a sling or longbow. You can also add your Dexterity Modifier to your Attack Roll and your Damage Roll when attacking with a melee weapon that has the finesse property, such as a dagger or a rapier
     Armor Class: Depending on the armor you wear, you might add some or all of your Dexterity Modifier to your Armor Class
     Initiative: At the beginning of every combat you roll Initiative by making a Dexterity Check. Initiative determines the order of creatures' turns in combat.</details>
	</rule>
	<rule>
		<title>Hiding</title>
		<details>     When you try to hide, make a Stealth check. Until you are discovered or you stop hiding, that check's total is contested by the Perception check of any creature actively searching for signs of your presence.
     You can't hide from a creature that can see you, and if you make noise (such as shouting a warning or knocking over a vase), you give away your position. An invisible creature can't be seen so it can always try to hide. Signs of its passage may still be noticed however and it must still remain silent.
     In combat, most creatures stay alert for signs of danger all around, so if you come out of hiding and approach a creature it usually sees you. Under certain circumstances however, the DM might allow you to stay hidden as you approach a creature that is distracted, allowing you to gain advantage on an attack before you are seen
     Passive Perception: When you hide, there's a chance someone will notice you even if they aren't actively searching. To determine whether such a creature notices you, the DM compares your Stealth check to the passive perception of others. If they have advantage/disadvantage, they add/subtract 5 from their passive scores. One of the main factors determining whether you can find a hidden creature or object is how well you can see in an area, which might be Lightly or Heavily Obscured.</details>
	</rule>
	<rule>
		<title>Constitution</title>
		<details>     Constitution measures health, stamina, and vital force.
     Constitution Checks: Constitution checks are uncommon, and no skills apply to Constitution checks, because the endurance this ability represents is largely passive rather than involving specific effort on the part of a character or monster. A Constitution check can model your attempt to push beyond normal limits however.
     The DM might call for a Constitution check when you try to accomplish tasks like the following
          - Hold your breath
          - March or labor for hours without rest
          - Go without sleep
          - Survive without food and water
          - Quaff an entire stein of ale in one go
     Hit Points: Your Constitution modifier contributes to your hit points. Typically, you add your Constitution modifier to each Hit Die you roll for your hit points. If your Constitution modifier changes, your hit point maximum changes as well, as though you had the new modifier from 1st level.</details>
	</rule>
	<rule>
		<title>Intelligence</title>
		<details>An Intelligence check comes into play when you need to draw on logic, education, memory, or deductive reasoning. The Arcana, History, Investigation, Nature, and Religion skills reflect aptitude in certain kinds of Intelligence Checks
     - Arcana: Arcana checks measure your ability to recall lore about spells, magic items, eldritch symbols, magical traditions, the planes of existence, and the inhabitants of those planes.
     - History: History checks measure your ability to recall lore about historical events, legendary people, ancient kingdoms, past disputes, recent wars, and lost civilizations.
     - Investigation: When you look around for clues and make deductions based on those clues, you make an Investigation check. You might deduce the location of a hidden object, discern from the appearance of a wound what kind of weapon dealt it, or determine the weakest point in a tunnel that could cause it to collapse. Poring through ancient scrolls in search of a hidden fragment of knowledge might also call for an Investigation check.
     - Nature: Nature checks measure your ability to recall lore about terrain, plants, animals, the weather, and natural cycles.
     - Religion: Religion checks measure your ability to recall lore about deities, rites, prayers, religious hierarchies, holy symbols, and the practices of secret cults
     Other Intelligence Checks: The DM might call for an Intelligence check when you try to accomplish tasks like the following
          - Communicate with a creature without using words
          - Estimate the value of a precious item
          - Pull together a disguise to pass as a city guard
          - Forge a document
          - Recall lore about a craft or trade

		<title>Wisdom</title>
		<details>     A Wisdom check might reflect an effort to read body langauge, understand someone's feelings, notice things about the environment, or care for an injured person. The Animal Handling, Insight, Medicine, Perception, and Survival skills reflect aptitude in certain kinda of Wisdom checks.
     - Animal Handling: When there is any question whether you can calm down a domesticated animal, keep a mount from getting spooked, or intuit an animal's intentions, the DM might call for an Animal Handling check. You also make an Animal Handling check to control your mount when you attempt a risky maneuver
     - Insight: Insight checks decide whether you can determine the true intentions of a creature, such as when searching out a lie or predicting someone's next move. Doing so involves gleaning clues from body language, speech habits, and changes in mannerisms
     - Medicine: A Medicine check lets you try to stabilize a dying companion or diagnose an illness
     - Perception: Perception checks let you spot, hear, or otherwise detect the presence of something. It measures your general awareness of your surroundings and the keenness of your senses. For example, you might try to hear a conversation through a closed door, eavesdrop under an open window, or hear monsters moving stealthily in the forest. Or oyu might try to spot things that are obscured or easy to miss, whether they are orcs lying in ambush, thugs hiding in an alley, or candlelight under a secret door.
     - Survival: The DM might ask you to make a Survival check to follow tracks, hunt wild game, guide a group through the wastelands, identify signs that owlbears live nearby predict the weather, or avoid natural hazards
     Other Wisdom Checks: The DM might call for a Wisdom check when you try to accomplish tasks like the following
          - Get a gut feeling about what course of action to follow
          - Discern whether a seemingly dead or living creature is undead
     Spellcasting Ability: Clerics, Druids, and Rangers use Wisdom as their Spellcasting Ability, which helps determine the saving throw DCs of spells they cast</details>

		<title>Charisma</title>
		<details>     A Charisma check might arise when you try to influence or entertain others, when you try to make an impression or tell a convincing lie, or when you are navigating a tricky social situation. The Deception, Intimidate, Performance, and Persuasion skills reflect aptitude in certain kinds of Charisma checks
     - Deception: Deception checks determine whether you can convincingly hide the truth, either verbally or through your actions. This deception can encompass everything from misleading others through ambiguity to telling outright lies. Typical situations include trying to fast-talk a guard, con a merchant, earn money through gambling, pass yourself off in a disguise, dull someone's suspicions with false assurances, or maintain a straight face while telling a blatant lie
     - Intimidate: When you attempt to influence someone through overt threats, hostile actions, and physical violence, the DM might ask you to make an Intimidation check. Examples include trying to pry information out of a prisoner, convincing street thugs to back down from a confrontation, or using the edge of a broken bottle to convince a sneering vizier to reconsider a decision
     - Performance: Performance checks determine how well you can delight an audience with music, dance, acting, storytelling, or some other form of entertainment.
     - Persuasion: When you attempt to influence someone or a group of people with tact, social graces, or good nature, the DM might ask you to make a Persuasion check. Typically you use persuasion when acting in good faith, to foster friendships, make cordial requests, or exhibit proper etiquette. Examples of persuading others include convincing a chamberlain to let your party see the king, negotiating peace between warring tribes, or inspiring a crowd of townsfolk
     Other Charisma Checks: The DM might call for a Charisma check when you try to accomplish tasks like the following
          - Find the best person to talk to for news, rumors, and gossip
          - Blend into a crowd to get the sense of key topics of conversation
     Spellcasting Ability: Bards, Paladins, Sorcerers, and Warlocks use Charisma as their Spellcasting Ability, which helps determine the saving throw DCs of spells they can cast.</details>

		<title>Saving Throws</title>
		<details>     A saving throw - also called a Save - represents an attempt to resist a spell, a trap, a poison, a disease, or a similar threat. You don't normally decide to make a Save, you are forced to make one because your character or a monster is at risk of harm.
     To make a Save, roll a d20 and add the appropriate Ability Modifier. A saving throw can be modified by situational bonuses and penalties and can be affected by Advantage and Disadvantage as determined by the DM.
     Each class gives proficiency in at least two saving throws. The Wizard for example has Proficiency in Intelligence and Wisdom saves. As with skill proficiencies, proficiency in a saving throw lets a character add their proficiency bonus to saves using that Ability Modifier. Some monsters have Saving Throw Proficiencies as well.
     The Difficulty Class for a saving throw is determined by the effect that causes it. For instance, the DC for a saving throw allowed by a spell is determined by the caster's Spellcasting Ability and Proficiency Bonus. The result of a successful or failed saving throw is also detailed in the effect that allows the save. Usually a successful save means that the creature suffers no harm or reduced harm from an effect.</details>
	</rule>
	<rule>
		<title>Time</title>
		<details>     In situations where keeping track of the passage of time is important, the DM determines the time a task requires. The DM might use a different time scale depending ont he context of the situation at hand. In a dungeon environment, the adventurers' movement happens on a scale of Minutes. It takes them about a minute to creep down a long hallway, another minute to check for traps on the door at the end of the hall, and a good ten minutes to search a chamber beyond for anything interesting or valuable.
     In a city or wilderness, a scale of Hours is often more appropriate. Adventurers eager to reach the lonely tower at the heart of the forest hurry across those fifteen miles in just under four hours' time.
     For long journeys, a scale of Days work best. Following the road from Baldur's Gate to Waterdeep, the adventurers spend four uneventful days before a goblin ambush interrupts their journey.
     In combat and other fast-paced situations, the game relies on Rounds, a six-second span of time.</details>
	</rule>
	<rule>
		<title>Movement</title>
		<details>     Swimming across a rushing river, sneaking down a dungeon corridor, scaling a treacherous mountain slope - all sorts of movement play a key role in D&amp;D adventures.
     The DM can summarise the adventurers' movement without calculating exact distances or travel times. "You travel through the forest and find the dungeon entrance late int he evening of the third day." Even in a dungeon, particualr a large dungeon or a cave network, the DM can summarize the movement between encounters. "After killing the guardian at the entrance to the ancient dwarven stronghold, you consult your map, which leads you through miles of echoing corridors to a chasm bridged by a narrow stone arch."
     Sometimes though, it's important to know how long it takes to get from one spot to another, whether the answer is in Days, Hours, Minutes, or even Seconds. The rules for determining travel time depend on two factors: The Speed and The Travel Pace of the creatures moving and the terrain they're moving over.</details>
	</rule>
	<rule>
		<title>Speed</title>
		<details>Every character and monster has a speed, which is the distance in feet that the character or monster can walk in one round. This number assumes short bursts of energetic movement in the midst of a life-threatening situation. The following rules determine how far a character or monster can move in a minute, an hour, or a day.
     Travel Pace: While traveling, a group of adventurers can move at a normal, fast, or slow pace, as shown in a travel pace listing. The listing states how far the party can move in a period of time and whether the pace has any effect. A fast pace makes the characters less perceptive, while a slow pace makes it possible to sneak around and to search an area more carefully per "Activity While Traveling".
     - Forced March: The Travel Pace listing assumes that characters travel for 8 hours in a day. They can push on beyond that limit, at the risk of exhaustion. For each additional hour beyond 8 hours traveled, the characters cover the distance shown in the Hour column for their pace, and each character must make a Constitution Saving Throw at the end of the hour. The DC is 10 + 1 for each hour past 8 hours. On a failed saving throw, a character suffers one level of exhaustion.
     - Mounts and Vehicles: For short spans of time (up to an hour), many animals move much faster than humanoids. A mounted character can ride at a gallop for about an hour, covering twice the usual distance for a fast pace. If fresh mounts are available every 8 to 10 miles, characters can cover large distances at this pace, but this is very rare except in densely populated areas.
     Characters in wagons, carriages, and other land vehicles choose a pace as normal. Characters in a waterborne vessel are limited to the speed of the vessel, and they don't suffer penalties for a fast pace or gain benefits from a slow pace. Depending on the vessel and the size of the crew, ships might be able to travel for up to 24 hours per day.
     Certain special mounts, such as a pegasus or griffon, or special vehicles such as the Carpet of Flying, allow you to travel more swiftly. The Dungeon Master's Guide contains more information on special methods of travel.
     =Travel Pace Listing=
                 Distance Traveled Per
       PACE   | Minute |  Hour  |  Day  | Effect
     - Fast   | 400 ft |  4 mi  | 30 mi | -5 penalty to passive Perception checks
     - Normal | 300 ft |  3 mi  | 24 mi | no effect
     - Slow   | 200 ft |  2 mi  | 18 mi | able to use Stealth
     Difficult Terrain: The travels speeds given in the Travel Pace Listing assume relatively simple terrain: roads, open plains, or clear dungeon corridors. But adventurers often face dense forests, deep swamps, rubble-filled ruins, steep mountains, and ice-covered ground - all considered difficult terrain. You move at half speed in difficult terrain - moving 1 foot through the difficult terrain costs you 2 feet of movement - so you can cover only have the normal distance in a minute, an hour, or a day.</details>
	</rule>
	<rule>
		<title>Special Types of Movement</title>
		<details>     Movement through dangerous dungeons or wilderness areas often involves more than simply walking. Aventurers might have to climb, crawl, swim, or jump to get where they need to go.
     Climbing, Swimming, and Crawling: While climbing or swimming, each foot of movement costs one extra foot (2 extra feet in difficult terrain) unless a creature has a climbing or swimming speed. At the DM's option, climbing a slippery vertical surface or one with a few handholds, and also attempting to swim through rough water requires a successful Athletics check
     Jumping: Your Strength determines how far you can jump.
     - Long Jump: When you make a long jump, you cover a number of feet up to your Strength score if you move at least 10 feet on foot immediately before the jump. When you make a standing long jump, you can leap only half that distance. Either way, each foot you clear on the jump costs a foot of movement. This rule assumes the height of your jump doesn't matter, such as a jump across a stream or a chasm. At your DM's option, you must succeed on a DC 10 Athletics check to clear a low obstacle (no taller than a quarter of the Jump's distance) such as a hedge or low wall. Otherwise you hit it. When you land in difficult terrain, you must succeed on a DC 10 Acrobatics check to land on your feet, otherwise you land prone.
     - High Jump: When you make a high jump, you leap into the air a number of feet equal to 3 + your Strength modifier if you move at least 10 feet on foot immediately before your jump. When you make a standing high jump you can jump only half that distance. Either way, each foot you clear on the jump costs a foot of movement. In some situations the DM might allow you to make an Atheltics check to jump higher than you normally can. You can extend your arms half your height above yourself during the jump, thus you can reach above you a distance equal to the height of your jump plus 1.5 times your height.</details>
	</rule>
	<rule>
		<title>Activity While Traveling</title>
		<details>     As adventurers travel through a dungeon or the wilderness, they need to remain alert for danger, and some characters might perform other tasks to help the group's journey.
     Marching Order: The adventurers should establish a marching order. A marching order makes it easier to determine which characters are affected by traps, which ones can spot hidden enemies, and which ones are the closest to those enemies when a fight breaks out. A character might occupy the front rank, one or more middle ranks, or the back rank. When space is too tight, the marching order must change, usually by moving characters to the middle rank.
     - Fewer than Three Ranks: If an adventuring party arranges its marching order with only two ranks, they are a front rank and a back rank. If there's only one rank, it's considered a front rank.
     Stealth: While travleing at a slow pace, the characters can move stealthily. As long as they're not in the open, they can try to surprise or sneak by other creatures they encounter.
     Noticing Threats: Use the passive Perception scores of characters to determine whether anyone in the group notices a hidden threat. The DM might decide that a threat can be noticed only by characters in a particular rank. For example, as the characters are exploring a maze of tunnels, the DM might decide that only those in the back rank have a chance to hear or spot a stealthy creature following the group, while characters in the front and middle ranks cannot. While traveling at a fast pace, characters take a -5 to their passive Perception scores to notice hidden threats
     - Encountering Creatures: If the DM determines that the adventurers encounter other creatures while they're traveling. It's up to both groups to decide what happens next. Either group miht decide to attack, initiate a conversation, run away, or wait to see what the other group does.
     - Surprising Foes: If the adventurers encounter a hostile creature or group, the DM determines whether the adventurers or their foes might be surprised when combat erupts
     Other Activities: Characters who turn their attention to other tasks as the group travels ar enot focused on watching for danger. These characters don't contribute their passive Perception scores to the group's chance of noticing threats. However a character not watching for danger can do one of the following activities instead, or some other activity with the DM's permission
     - Navigate: The character can try to prevent the group from becoming lost, making a Survival check when the DM calls for it (The DM's Guide has rules about getting lost)
     - Draw a Map: The character can draw a map that records the group's progress and helps the characters get back on course if they get lost. No Ability Check is Required
     - Track: A character can follow the tracks of another creature, making a Survival check when the DM calls for it (the DM's Guide has rules about tracking)
     - Forage: The character can keep an eye out for ready sources of food and water, making a Survival check when the DM calls for it (The DM's Guide has rules about foraging)</details>
	</rule>
	<rule>
		<title>Falling</title>
		<details>     A fall from a great height is one of the most common hazards facing an adventurer. At the end of a fall, a creature takes 1d6 bludgeoning damage for every 10 feet it fell to a maximum of 20d6. The creature lands prone, unless it avoids taking damage from the fall.</details>
	</rule>
	<rule>
		<title>Suffocating</title>
		<details>     A creature can hold its breath for a number of minutes equal to 1 + its Constitution Modifier (mimimum of 30 seconds). When a creature runs out of breath, it can survive for a number of rounds equal to its Constitution Modifier (minimum of 1 round). At the start of its next turn, it drops to 0 hit points and it dying.</details>
	</rule>
	<rule>
		<title>Sidebar: Splitting Up the Party</title>
		<details>     Sometimes, it makes sense to split an adventuring party, especially if you want one or more characters to scout ahead. You can form multiple parties, each moving at a different speed. Each group has its own front, middle, and back ranks. The drawback to this approach is taht the party will be split into several smaller groups in the event of an attack. The advantage is that a small group of stealthy characters moving slowly might be able to sneak past enemies that clumsier characters would alert. A rogue and a monk moving at a slow pace are much harder to detect when they leave their dwarf paladin friend behind.</details>
	</rule>
	<rule>
		<title>Vision and Light</title>
		<details>     The most fundamental tasks of adventuring - noticing danger, finding hidden objects, hitting an enemy in combat, and targetting a spell, to name just a few - rely heavily on the character's ability to see. Darkness and other effects that obscure vision can prove a significant hindrance.
     - Lightly Obscured: A given area might be lightly or heavily obscured. In a Lightly Obscured area, such as dim light, patchy fog, or moderate foliage, creatures have Disadvantage on Perception checks that rely on sight.
     - Heavily Obscured: A Heavily Obscured area - such as darkness, opaque fog, or dense foliage - blocks vision entirely. A creature in a heavily obscured area effectively suffers from the blinded condition
     The presence or absence of light in an environment creates three categories of illumination: bright light, dim light, and darkness
     - Bright Light: Lets most creatures see normally. Even gloomy days provide bright light, as do torches, lanterns, fires, and other sources of illumination within a specific radius
     - Dim Light: Also called shadows, creates a lightly obscured area. An area of dim light is usually a boundary between a source of bright light, such as a torch, and the surrounding darkness. The soft light of twilight and dawn also counts as dim light. A particularly brilliant full moon might bathe the land in dim light.
     - Darkness: creates a heavily obscured area. Character face darkness outdoors at night (even most moonlit nights), within the confines of an unlit dungeon or a subterranean vault, or in an area of magical darkness.
     Blindsight: A creature with blindsight can perceive its surroundings without relyingon sight within a specific radius. Creatures without eyes, such as oozes, and creatures with echolocation or heightened senses, such as bats and true dragons, have this sense.
     Darkvision: Many creatures in the worlds of D&amp;D, especially those that dwell undergound, have darkvision. Within a specified range, a creature with darkvision can see in darkness as if the darkness were dim light, so areas of darkness are only lightly obscured as far as that creature is concerned. However, the creature can't discern color in darkness, only shades of gray.
     Truesight: A creature with truesight can, out to a specific range, see in normal and magical darkness, see invisible creatures and objects, automatically detect visual illusions and succeed on saving throws against them, and perceives the original form of a shapechanger or a creature that is transformed by magic. Furthermore, the creature can see into the Ethereal Plane</details>
	</rule>
	<rule>
		<title>Food and Water</title>
		<details>     Characters who don't eat or drink suffer the effects of exhaustion. Exhaustion caused by lack of food or water can't be removed until the character eats and drinks the full required amount.
     Food: A character needs one pound of food per day and can make food last longer by subsisting on half rations, heading half a pound of food in a day counts as half a day without food. A character can go without food for a number of days equal to 3 + their Constitution Modifier (minimum of 1). At the end of each day beyond that limit, a character automatically suffers one level of Exhaustion. A normal day of eating resets the count of days without food to zero.
     Water: A character needs one gallon of water per day, or two per day if the weather is hot. A character who drinks only half that much water must succeed on a DC 15 Constitution save or suffer one level of Exhaustion at the end of the day. A character with access to even less water automatically suffers one level of Exhaustion at the end of the day. If the character already has one or more levels of Exhaustion, the character takes two levels in either case</details>
	</rule>
	<rule>
		<title>Interacting with Objects</title>
		<details>     A character's interaction with objects in an environment is often simple to resolve in game. The player tells the DM that his or her character is doing something, such as moving a level, and the DM describes what, if anything, happens.
     For example, a character might decide to pull a lever, which might in turn raise a portcullis, cause a room to flood with water, or open a secret door in a nearby wall. If the lever is rested in position though, a character might need to force it. In such a situation the DM might call for a Strength check to see whether the character can wrench the lever into place. The DM sets the DC for any such check based on the difficulty of the task.
     Characters can also damage objects with their weapons and spells. Objects are immune to poison and psychic damage, but otherwise they can be affected by physical and magical attacks like creatures can. The DM determines the object's Armor Class and hit points and might decide that certiain objects have resistance or immunity to certain kings of attacks (it's hard to cut a rope with a club for example). Objects always fail Strength and Dexterity saving throws, and they are immune to effects that require other saves. When an object drops to 0 HP it breaks. A character can also attempt a Strength check to outright break an object. The DM sets the DC for any such check.</details>
	</rule>
	<rule>
		<title>Resting</title>
		<details>Heroic though they might be, adventurers can't spend every hour of the day in the thick of exploration, social interaction, and combat. They need rest - time to sleep and eat, tend to their wounds, refresh their minds and spirits for spellcasting, and brace themselves for further adventure. Adventurers can take short rests in the midst of an adventuring day and a long rest to end the day.
     Short Rest: A short rest is a period of downtime, at least 1 hour long, during which a character does nothing more strenuous than eating, drinking, reading, and tending to wounds. A character can spend one or more Hit Dice at the end of a short rest, up to the character's maximum number of Hit Dice, which is equal to the character's total level. For each hit die spent in this way, the player rolls the die and add the character's Constitution Modifier to it. The character regains hit points equal to the total. The player can decide to spend additional Hit Die after each roll. A character ragins some spent Hit Dice upon finishing a long rest.
     Long Rest: A long rest is a period of extended downtime, at least 8 hours long, furing which a character sleeps or performs light activity, reading, talking, eating, or standing watch for no more than 2 hours. If the rest is interrupted by a period of strenuous activity - at least 1 hour of walking, fighting, casting spells, or similar adventuring activity - the characters must begin the rest again to gain any benefit from it. At the end of a long rest a character regains all lost hit points. They also regain spent Hit Dice up to half their total level. A character can't benefit from more than one long rest in a 24 hour period, and a character must have at least 1 hit point at the start of the rest to get the benefits.</details>
	</rule>
	<rule>
		<title>Between Adventures</title>
		<details>     Between trips to dungeons and battles against ancient evils, adventurers need time to rest, recuperate, and prepare for their next adventure. Many adventurers also use this time to perform other tasks, such as crafting arms and armor, performing research, or spending their hard-earned gold.
     In some cases, the passage of time is something that occurs with little fanfare or description. When starting a new adventure, the DM might simply declare that a certain amount of time has passed and allow you to describe in general terms what your character has been doing. At other times, the DM might want to keep track of just how much time is passing as events beyond your perception stay in motion.
     Lifestyle Expenses: Between adventures you choose a particular quality of life and pay the cost of maintaining that lifestyle. Living a particular lifestyle doesn't have a huge effect on your character, but can affect the way other individuals or groups react to you. For example, if you live an aristocratic lifestyle, it might be easier for you to influence nobles in the city compared to if you lived as a pauper.
     Downtime Activities: Between adventures, the DM might ask you what your character is doing during his or her downtime. Periods of downtime can vary in duration, but each downtime activity requires a certain number of days to complete before you can any benefit, and at least 8 hours of each day must be spent on the downtime activity for the day to count. The days do not need to be consecutive. If you have more than the minimum amount of days to spend, you can keep doing the same thing for a longer period of time or switch to a new downtime activity. Downtime Activities other than the ones presented here are possible. If you want your character to spend their downtime performing an actvitiy not covered here, discuss it with your DM.
     - Crafting: You can craft nonmagical objects including adventuring equipment and works of art. You must be proficient with the tools of the trade (typically a form of Artisan's Tools). You might also need access to special materials or locations necessary to create it. For example, someone proficient with Smith's Tools needs a forge in order to craft a sword or suit of armor.
     For every day of downtime you spend crafting, you can craft one or more items with a total market value not exceeding 5 GP, and you must expend raw materials worth have the total market value. If something you want to craft has a marge value greater than 5 GP, you make progress every day in 5 GP increments until you reach the market value of that item. For example, a suit of plate armor takes 300 days (1500 GP value) to craft on your own. Bear in mind, multiple people with proficiency in the trade can work together on the same project, each providing 5 GP worth of work into the project each day.
     While crafting, you can maintain a modest lifestyle without expending 1 GP per day, or a comfortable lifestyel at half the normal cost.
     - Practicing a Profession: You can work between adventures, allowing you to maintiain a modest lifestyle without having to pay 1 GP per day. This benefit lasts as long as you continue to practice your profession. If you are a member of an organization that can provide gainful eomployment, such as a temple or a theives' guild, you earn enough to support a comfortable lifestyle instead. If you have proficiency in the Performance skill and put that skill to use during your downtime, you can earn enough to support a wealthy lifestyle instead.
     - Recuperating: You can use downtime between adventures to recover from a debilitating injury, disease, or poison. After three days of downtime spent recuperating, you can make a DC 15 Constitution saving throw. On a successful save, you can choose one of the following results.
          - End one effect on you that prevents you from regaining Hit Points.
          - For the next 24 hours, gain advantage on saving throws against one disease or poison currently affecting you.
     - Researching: The time between adventures is a great chance to perform research, gaining insight into mysteries that have unfurled over the course of the campaign. Research can include poring over dusty tomes and crumbling scrolls in a library or buying drinks for the locals to pry rumors and gossip from them.
     When you begin your research, the DM determines whether the information is available, how many days of downtime it'll take to find it, and whether there are any restrictions on your research (such as needing to seek out a specific individual, tome, or location). The DM might also require you to make one or more ability checks, such as an Investigation check to find clues pointing towards the information you seek or a Persuasion check to secure soemone's aid. Once those conditions are met, you learn the information if available. For each day of research, you must spend 1 GP to cover your expenses. This cost is in addition to your normal lifestyle expenses.
     - Training: You can spend time between adventures learning a new language or training with a set of tools. Your DM might allow additional training options. First, you must find an instructor willing to teach you. The DM determines how long this takes, and whether one or more ability checks are required. The training lasts for 250 days and costs 1 GP per day. After you spend the requisite amount of Time and Money, you learn the new language or gain proficiency with the new tool.</details>

		<title>The Order of Combat</title>
		<details>     A typical combat encounter is a clash between two sides, a flurry of weapon swings, feints, parries, footwork, and spellcasting. The game organizes the chaos of combat into a cycle of rounds and turns. A round represents about 6 seconds in the game world. During a round each participant in a battle takes a turn. The order of turns is determined at the beginning of a combat encounter, when everyone rolls initiative. Once everyone has taken a turn, the fight continues to the next round if neither side has defeated the other.
     Surprise: A band of adventurers sneaks up on a bandit camp, springing from the trees to attack them. A gelatinous cube glides down a dungeon passage, unnoticed by the adventurers until the cube engulfs one of them. In these situations, one side of the battle gains surprise over the other.
     The DM determines who might be surprised. If neither side tries to be stealthy, they automatically notice each other. Otherwise the DM compares the Stealth checks of anyone hidig with the passive Perception score of each creature on the opposing side. Any character or monster that doesn't notice a threat is surprised at the start of the encounter. If you're surprised you can't move or take an action on your first turn of the combat, and you can't take a reaction until that turn ends. A member of a group can be surprised even if the others are not.
     Initiative: Initiative determines the order of turns during combat. When combat starts everyone makes a Dexterity check to determine their place in the initiative oder. The DM makes one roll for an entire group of identical creatures, so each member of the group acts at the same time.
     The DM ranks the combatants in order from highest to lowest Dexterity check total. This is the order in which they act during each round. The initiative order remains the same from round to round. If a tie occurs, the DM decides the order among DM-Controlled creatures, and the players decide the order among tied characters. The DM can decide the order if the tie is between a monster and a player character. Optionally the DM cna have the tied characters and monsters each roll a d20 to determine the order, highest roll going first.
     Your Turn: On your turn, you can move a distance up to your speed and take one action. You decide whether to move first or take your action first. Your speed is noted on your character sheed.The most common actions you can take are described in "Actions in Combat". Many class features and other abilities provide additional options for your action. The "Movement and Position" section gives rules for your movement. You can forgo moving, taking an action, or doing anything at all on your turn. If you can't decide what to do on your turn, consider taking the Dodge or Ready action.
     - Bonus Actions: Various class features, spells, and other abilities let you take an additional action on your turn called a bonus action. You can take a bonus action only when a special ability, spell, or other feature of the game states that you can do something as a Bonus Action. You otherwise don't have a bonus action to take. You can only take one bonus action on your turn, so you must choose which to use when you have more than one available. You choose when to take a bonus action during your turn, unless the bonus action's timing is specified, and anything you do that deprives you of your ability to take actions also prevents you from taking a bonus action.
     - Other Activity On Your Turn: Your turn can include a variety of flourishes that require neither your action nor your move. You can communicate however you are able, through brief utterances and gestures, as you take your turn. You can also interact with one object or feature of the environment for free, during either your move or your action. For Example, you could open a door during your move as you stride toward a foe, or you could draw your weapon as part of the same action you use to attack. If you want to interact with a second object you have to use your action to do so. Some magic items and other special objects always require an action to use as stated in their description. The DM might require you to use an action for any of these activities when it needs special care or when it presents an unusual obstacle.
     Reactions: Certain special abilities, spells, and situations allow you to take a special action called a reaction. A reaction is an instant response to a trigger of some kind which can occur on your turn or on someone else's. The opportunity attack is the most common type of reaction. When you take a reaction, you can't take another one until the start of your next turn. If the reaction interrupts another creature's turn, that creature can continue its turn right after the reaction.</details>

		<details>     1. Determine surprise: The DM determines whether anyone involved in the combat encounter is surprised.
     2. Establish positions: the DM decides where all the characters and monsters are located. Given the adventurers' marching order or their stated positions in the room or other location, the DM figures out where the adversaries are - how far away and in what direction.
     3. Roll Initiative: Everyone involved in the combat encounter rolls initiative, determining the order of combatants' turns.
     4. Take turns: Each participant in the battle takes a turn in initiative order.
     5. Begin the next round: When everyone involve in the combat has had a turn, the round ends. Repeat step 4 until the fighting stops.</details>

		<title>Movement and Position</title>
		<details>     In combat, characters and monsters are in constant motion, often using movement and position to gain the upper hand. On your turn you can move a distance up to your speed. You can use as much or as little of your speed as you like on your turn, following the rules here. Your movement can include jumping, climbing, and swimming. These different mode of movement can be combined with walking, or they can constitute your entire move. However you're moving, you deduct the distance of each part of your move from your speed until it is used up or until you are done movinig. The "Special Types of Movement" section gives the particulars for jumping, climbing, and swimming.
     Breaking up Your Move: You can break up your movement on your turn, using some of your speed before and after your action. For example, if you have a speed of 30 feet you can move 10 feet, take your action, and then move 20 feet.
     - Moving Between Attacks: If you take an action that includes more than one weapon attack, you can break up your movement even further by moving between those attacks. For example, a fighter who can make two attacks with the extra attack feature can move any distance, attack, move any distance, and attack again.
     - Using Different Speeds: If you have more than one speed, such as your walking speed and a flying speed, you can switch back and forth between your speeds during your move. Whenever you switch, subtract the distance you've already moved from your new speed. The result determines how much farther you can move. If the result is 0 or less, you can't use the new speed during the current move.
     Difficult Terrain: Combat rarely takes place in bare rooms or on featureless plains. Boulder-strewn caverns, briar-choked forests, treacherous staircases - the setting of a typical fight contains difficult terrain. Every foot of movement in difficult terrain costs 1 extra foot. This rule is true even if multiple things in a space count as difficult terrain. Low furniture, rubble, undergrowth, steep stairs, snow, and shallow bogs are examples of difficult terrain. The space of another creature, hostile or not, also counts as difficult terrain.
     Being Prone: Combatants often find themselves lying on the ground, either because theya re knocked down or because they throw themselves down. In the game, they are prone, as described in "Conditions". You can drop prone without using any of your speed. Standing up takes more effort; doing so costs half your speed. For example, if you can move 30 feet, it takes 15 feet to stand from prone. If you don't have enough left over, you can't do it. To move while prone, you must crawl of use magic such as teleportation. Every foot of movement while crawling costs 1 extra foot. Crawling one foot in difficult terrain therefore costs 3 feet of movement for every 1 foot traveled.</details>
